## Welcome to Cortana Reminders Fork!

Cortana Reminders Fork is an unofficial replacement for Cortana's Reminders, active from 2016-2020.
### What is this?
From August 2, 2016 to September 21, 2020, a reminder service (**Reminders WinRT OOP Service**) was used to remind users of their daily chores. When Windows 10 20H1 was released, this feature was replaced by Microsoft ToDo, which was even worse than Cortana. Also, Cortana was killed in Windows 11 (released on October 5, 2021).

### What does it do?

Cortana Reminders used a service to facilitate these reminders, but was removed in 20H1. The user had to open Cortana, go to her notebook, go to reminders, and click the Plus sign to add a reminder. This service had the ability to add a photo, which was the best part of the program. Also, this service reminded you even when the computer was turned off, which ToDo does NOT have this. ðŸ¤¨

With this fork, A new service powered by PowerShell and Task Scheduler provides this replacement, with a few tweaking needed to produce the output, the perfect reminder!
